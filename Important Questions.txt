fori	for (int i = 0; i < expr.length; i++)	Creates a for statement which iterates over an array
forr	for (int i = expr.length-1; i >= 0; iâ€“)	Creates a for statement which iterates over an array in reverse order
if	if (expr)	Creates a if statement
nnull	if (expr != null)	Creates an if statement and checks if the expression does not resolve to null
null	if (expr == null)	Creates an if statement which checks if expression resolves to null
sysout	System.out.println(expr)	Sends the affected string to a System.out.println(..) call
